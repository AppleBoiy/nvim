### Installation

To use my personal Neovim configuration, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your Neovim configuration directory (`~/.config/nvim`) using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/AppleBoiy/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. Open Neovim and let it install any required plugins. You may need to restart Neovim for the changes to take effect.
